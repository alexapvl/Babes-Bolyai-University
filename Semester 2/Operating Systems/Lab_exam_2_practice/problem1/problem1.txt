Write a C program that receives as command line arguments pairs of strings and numbers.
For each argument pair, create a new process that launches a C or Shell program that 
calculates the number of vowels in the string and, if it is equal with the second argument 
in the pair, it prints it together with the string on stdout.

Example:
/prog string 5 adventure 4 chocolate 4 elephant 3
adventure 4
chocolate 4
elephant 3
