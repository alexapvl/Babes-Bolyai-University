Write a C program that creates a child process. The parent wprocess will read integers from standard input.
After reading each integer N, the parent process will send it via pipe to the child process, 
which will generate and send back to the parent the first N numbers from the Fibonacci sequence via pipe.
The parent process will read and print the received numbers from the child process.
The parent and child will terminate if the parent readsfrom standard input a number 
less than or equal to zero.
The program will perform error checks and handling.
